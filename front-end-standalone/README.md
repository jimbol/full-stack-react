# Front-End Standalone
This application uses React and Redux Toolkit to make a fully functioning Q&A app that can run locally on your machine.

## Practice
Challenge yourself by trying to create your own front-end application from scratch.

- Create module folder structure
- Create the router with stubbed pages
- Design your data structures and create Redux Toolkit slices for your data
- Create your other components and connect them to your Redux data store.

## Installation
### `yarn install`
Installs dependencies from the package.json file. You may run `npm install` instead.

## Starting From Scratch
If you would like to start a new project from scratch, create a working folder and start your react project in that folder.
```
npx create-react-app .
```

To use the same tools used in class run the following installation scripts.
```
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
yarn add react-router-dom@6 history@5
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
yarn add uuid
```

Now you're ready to start building from scratch.

# Original Create React App README
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

You may run `npm start` instead.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

You may run `npm test` instead.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

You may run `npm build` instead.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

You may run `npm eject` instead.
